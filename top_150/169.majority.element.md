# 169.majority.element

The problem is to find the majority element in an array. A majority element in an array is an element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times, where n is the length of the array.

Here's the full description of the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Approach

Since, according to the problem constraints, we know that a majority element is always present in the array, I thought of applying the `Boyer-Moore` algorithm.

I use a variable `v` to store the majority element and a variable `c` as a counter. The program scans the array, and:

- If `c` is 0, it considers the current element as the majority element.
- If `c` element is equal to the currently considered majority element, it increments the counter.
- If the current element is different from the currently considered majority element, it decrements the counter.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

```python 
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        c = 0
        v = 0 
        
        for i in range(0, len(nums)) :
            if c == 0:
                v = nums[i]
                c += 1
            elif nums[i] == v :
                c += 1
            else: c -= 1
        
        return v
            
nums = [3,2,3]
sol1 = Solution()    
result = sol1.majorityElement(nums)    
print(result)    
```
