# 121.best.time.to.buy.and.sell.stock

Here's the full description of the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Approach

The given code uses a simple approach to find the maximum profit. It iterates through the array of prices, keeping track of the minimum price (`buy`) and updating the maximum profit whenever a higher selling price is encountered. The idea is to find the minimum price to buy and then sell when the price is higher, maximizing the profit.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n), where `n` is the length of the prices array
- Space complexity: O(1)

# code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        profit = 0
        buy = prices[0]
        for sell in prices[1:]:
            if sell > buy:
                profit = max(profit, sell - buy)
            else:
                buy = sell
        
        return profit
    
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
sol1 = Solution()
result = sol1.maxProfit(prices)
print(result)
```
