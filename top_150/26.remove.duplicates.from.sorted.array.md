# 26.remove.duplicates.from.sorted.array

Here's the full description of the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Approach

To solve this problem in-place, I use two pointers. One pointer (`unique`) keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed, and the other pointer (`i`) iterates through the array.

If the current element is different from the previous one, we increment the `unique` and move the current element to the unique position. This ensures that duplicate elements are skipped, and only unique elements are placed at the beginning of the array.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n) - where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(1)

# code

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums :
            return 0
        
        unique = 0
        
        for i in range (1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                unique += 1
                nums[unique] = nums[i]
        return unique + 1 
    
nums =[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
sol1 = Solution() 

result = sol1.removeDuplicates(nums)
print(result)
print(nums[:result])
```
