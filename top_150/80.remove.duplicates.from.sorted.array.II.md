# 80.remove.duplicates.from.sorted.array.II

Here's the full description of the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Approach

To solve this problem in-place, I use two pointers. One pointer (`unique`) keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed, and the other pointer (`i`) iterates through the array.

If the current element is different from the last two elements in the processed part of the array, it is considered a new unique element and is placed at the position indicated by the `unique` pointer.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n) - where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(1)

# code
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 2:
            return len(nums)

        unique = 2 

        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[unique - 1] or nums[i] != nums[unique - 2]:
                nums[unique] = nums[i]
                unique += 1

        return unique
        
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
sol1 = Solution()
result = sol1.removeDuplicates(nums)
print(result)
print(nums[:result])
```
