# 189.rotate.array

The problem is to rotate an array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Here's the full description of the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Approach

The given code uses slicing to rotate the array to the right by `k` steps. It first calculates the effective rotation amount by taking the remainder of `k` divided by the length of the array to handle cases where `k` is larger than the length of the array. Then, it uses slicing to concatenate the last `k` elements with the first `len(nums) - k` elements.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

# code

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        k = k % len(nums)
        nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[: -k]
```
