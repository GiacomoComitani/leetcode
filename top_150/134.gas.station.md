# 134.gas.station

Here's the full description of the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Approach

The idea is to iterate through the gas stations and maintain two variables, `total_gas` and `current_gas`.

- `total_gas`: Represents the overall gas surplus or deficit, initialized to 0.
- `current_gas`: Represents the remaining gas at the current station, initialized to 0.
- `start_index`: Keeps track of the potential starting index.

The program iterates through the gas stations, updating `total_gas` and `current_gas` based on the difference between gas and cost at each station. If `current_gas` becomes negative, it means the current start point is not valid, so we update `start_index` to the next station and reset `current_gas` to 0.

After iterating through all stations, the program checks if `total_gas` is negative. If it is, there is no valid solution, and we return -1. Otherwise, we return the `start_index` as the answer.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  O(n), where `n` is the number of gas stations.
- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code

```python
from typing import List 

class Solution:
    
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        total_gas = 0
        current_gas = 0
        start_index = 0

        for i in range(len(gas)):
            total_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
            current_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]

            if current_gas < 0:
                current_gas = 0
                start_index = i + 1

        if total_gas < 0:
            return -1
        else:
            return start_index
```
