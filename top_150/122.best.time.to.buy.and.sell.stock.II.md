# 122.best.time.to.buy.and.sell.stock.II

Here's the full description of the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Approach

The program iterates over the array prices, and if the current element is greater than the previous one, it adds the difference to the variable profit.


# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n), where `n` is the length of prices
- Space complexity: O(1)

# code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
     def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += prices[i]-prices[i-1]
        return profit
    
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
sol1 = Solution()
result = sol1.maxProfit(prices)
print(result)
```
