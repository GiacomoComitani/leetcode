# 274.h-index

Here's the full description of the [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

# Approach

The approach involves sorting the given array of citations in descending order.
Then, iterate through the sorted array, and for each index `h`, check if the value
at that index is greater than or equal to `h`. Continue incrementing `h` until
either the end of the array is reached or the condition is no longer met.

# Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(log(n)) where `n` is the length of `citations`
- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code

```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations.sort(reverse=True)
        h = 0
        while h < len(citations) and citations[h] > h:
            h += 1
        return h
```
